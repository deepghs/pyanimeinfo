    """
    Configure the HTTP backend by providing a `backend_factory`. Any HTTP calls made by `huggingface_hub` will use a
    Session object instantiated by this factory. This can be useful if you are running your scripts in a specific
    environment requiring custom configuration (e.g. custom proxy or certifications).

    Use [`get_session`] to get a configured Session. Since `requests.Session` is not guaranteed to be thread-safe,
    `huggingface_hub` creates 1 Session instance per thread. They are all instantiated using the same `backend_factory`
    set in [`configure_http_backend`]. A LRU cache is used to cache the created sessions (and connections) between
    calls. Max size is 128 to avoid memory leaks if thousands of threads are spawned.

    See [this issue](https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/2766) to know more about thread-safety in `requests`.

    Example:
    ```py
    import requests
    from huggingface_hub import configure_http_backend, get_session

    # Create a factory function that returns a Session with configured proxies
    def backend_factory() -> requests.Session:
        session = requests.Session()
        session.proxies = {"http": "http://10.10.1.10:3128", "https": "https://10.10.1.11:1080"}
        return session

    # Set it as the default session factory
    configure_http_backend(backend_factory=backend_factory)

    # In practice, this is mostly done internally in `huggingface_hub`
    session = get_session()
